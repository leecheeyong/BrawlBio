## About

This project was inspired by a Discord Bot I made long time ago called [Jet Brawley](https://brawley.js.org), which is a Brawl Stars statistics bot.

## Features

- Track a player's statistics, brawlers & battle logs
- Track a club's statistics & members list
- Player, brawler, club icon integration
- Player's custom font color integration

## Credits

- [Royale API](https://royaleapi.com/) for their proxy endpoints, so that the API works on any IP address
- [Brawlify CDN](https://brawlify.com/) for their player, club & brawler icon
